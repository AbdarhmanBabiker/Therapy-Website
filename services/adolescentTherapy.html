        For many people, adolescence and the teenage years can be challenging.
         People are negotiating a variety of changes at this time of their lives,
          both physically and mentally. Feelings of worry, despair, and other
         mental health problems might result from these changes.
        Adolescents and teens who need assistance navigating these transitions and
        improving their mental health may benefit from therapy.
