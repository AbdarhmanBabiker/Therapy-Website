        Occupational therapy is a healthcare profession focused on helping individuals achieve 
        independence and improve their quality of life through meaningful engagement in daily 
        activities. Occupational therapists work with people of all ages, addressing physical, 
        cognitive, and emotional challenges that may hinder their ability to participate in daily
        tasks or work. By assessing individual needs, developing personalized intervention plans, 
        and utilizing purposeful activities, occupational therapists empower clients to enhance 
        their functional capabilities and lead fulfilling lives.
