        Online Therapy
Online therapy form of mental health treatment that is delivered remotely via the internet. 
This type of therapy allows individuals to receive counseling and support from licensed therapists 
and counselors from the comfort of their own homes, or wherever they may be. One of the main benefits 
of online therapy is convenience. It eliminates the need for travel to appointments, and allows for 
greater flexibility in scheduling sessions. 

This is especially beneficial for those who live in remote areas or have mobility issues, as well as 
for people who have busy schedules and find it difficult to take time off work or other responsibilities to 
attend in-person therapy sessions.
